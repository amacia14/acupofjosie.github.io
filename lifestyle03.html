			<i>Life after college is tough.</i>
			<p>
				Remember your Junior year of High School when you started planning out where you’d go to school in 2 years with sky-high goals to become that doctor/engineer/business owner? When you were promised a Bachelor’s degree would lead you to the path of success? When you changed your mind 100 times choosing a major and ended up choosing one not even close to what you had started with?

				And then you graduate. (Maybe)

				Rewind to 6 months before graduation: I had just scored a job in Chicago. The job (I thought) I wanted. I knew that I might have sold myself short, but I was so pumped to be the first of my friends to have security once school was over. I was eager to move onto this next chapter in my life.

				Fast forward to June: I was wrong. The job was not what I thought it was. The hours were long. I had no idea what I was doing and minimal training. I was mocked by superiors and was in constant fear of failure.

				I was so jealous of my friends who waited a bit longer and made sure they looked at all their options. The majority were making more money and/or were happier than I was. What did I do wrong?

				Fast forward another 6 months: I got laid off. The company was failing and I was one of many to be let go. Was I surprised? Yes. Was I disappointed? Not really. Was I freaking out? Absolutely. My loan repayment had just kicked in and I had already been considering getting a second job to be able to live more comfortably. Now I have no income? Initiate panic mode.
			</p>
			<i>Was I surprised? Yes. Was I disappointed? Not really. Was I freaking out? Absolutely.</i>
			<p>
				I went 5 weeks without a job. Being someone who hasn’t gone more than a week without working since I was 14, I felt like a bum. I had a strict salary requirement that I told myself I would not go under.

				Flash forward to week 5 of unemployment: Morale was running low. I had officially classified myself as a broke loser with no talent. OK maybe was being a little harsh on myself but I was so tired of getting questioned why I was back in Iowa at my parents or how I got “so lucky” to be able to stay for two whole weeks for Thanksgiving.

				As we do every year, a large group of the people I graduated with got together the day after Thanksgiving at a party and caught up with what everyone was doing. I had friends in the same rut I had been in at my old job and others who scored their own office already. There was still all those dreaded questions coming from every person I interacted with – “How is the big city life in Chicago?” I live in the suburbs. “What are you doing now? Do you love your job?” I’ve been crashing at my parents’ house so I don’t have to pay for groceries and I don’t have a job.

				When I finally gave up the act and told people what I was actually doing, there were sighs of relief. More than half of those people I had been putting up a front for were doing the same exact thing. Some people were even jealous me, having the ability to start over. Thinking about it, that was something I was super thankful for.

				The next week, I finally got a response to one of my job applications. A travel agency I had applied to wanted to meet later that week back in my city in Illinois. It wasn’t one of my top choices but I figured I needed to stop waiting around and bite the bait. I flexed the fact that I had my own website and strong social media skills. Apparently my passion for discovering new places and cultures stood out – I was hired on the spot.
			</p>
			<i>Was I surprised? Yes. Was I disappointed? Not really. Was I freaking out? Absolutely.</i>
			<p>
				Flash forward to now: I now love going to work everyday. I am not drained from rude customers. I work with happy people who have the same passion as I do. I am learning things I have an interest in. And things just keep getting better.

				Sometimes life doesn’t go the way you had planned. There are dips and turns but trust the process and keep <i> making it happen </i>.
