				Tis the season to be counting our blessings!

				We’ve almost made it a whole another year – woohoo! Sounds cheesy, but that is truly something to be thankful for!

				I don’t know about the rest of you but the past few days during this Thanksgiving have been filled with indulgence, gratitude, and reflection on how far my loved ones and I have come.

				I won’t lie to you when I say I probably had 3 pieces of pie yesterday. What day of the year do you have at least 3 different types of pie laying in front of you on the table? Was I going to offend my mother and not try all three kinds – heck no!

				Actually, my mom made two pumpkin pies, I bought a pecan pie from a local bake sale, and my sister asked me to make a chocolate pie. So, naturally, I had to have, like, 3 pieces of pumpkin pie to compliment my mom – right??

				And I will admit, I am quite particular how I like my pumpkin pie. The crust can’t be too crunchy AND the whip topping has to come from the tub, not the can! Does anyone else have weird preferences like that?? No? Just me? OK. Moving on…

				Did all of you share your list of what you’re thankful for at the dinner table yet? Although my family isn’t the type to spend forever gushing over how thankful we are for one another (even though we really, deeply are), we did make time to share a few things we were thankful for in a jokingly manner. I think I said something along the lines of ‘corndogs’ – what? I really am thankful for them!!

				However, I thought I would share what I am thankful for this year. Some very general things and some very specific things.

				<strong>Things I Am Thankful for in 2017:</strong>
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<i>Starting over –</i>
							<p>
								In May, I graduated from The University of Iowa with a BA in Communication Studies and Spanish. This had to be one of the proudest moments of my life. I had scored a job from the job fair in September so I was all set! One of my main goals for after college was to leave Iowa – nothing personal, Iowa. I just needed a change. So, after graduating, I packed up all my things and headed out to the Chicago suburbs where I began my new life. I had no friends, didn’t know the area, and was starting a new job – scary! Although this was a lot harder than I expected it to be, I am so glad I did it. It’s so hard to grow without throwing yourself into these situations.
							</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>My two nephews –</i>
							<p>
								Everyone who knows me, knows I love kids. Especially my two nephews. This year has been so fun watching them grow. I love coming home and seeing the excitement on their faces. I love video chatting them over the phone and always getting a tour of their bedroom or a performance of their new gymnastics moves. They even know my favorite color – how cool is that? Being an aunt is the best.
							</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Being able to go back to my favorite place in the world for Spring Break –</i>
							<p>
								Have you ever been somewhere and instantly fell in love? I am absolutely obsessed with<b>Alicante, Spain</b> . I studied abroad here, built the strongest relationships, learned how to be a nomad, became (almost) fluent in Spanish, and created the best memories. I was torn when I had to pack up my 1 suitcase and head back to the USA. One night in fall I was searching flight tickets just for fun (I do this way too often and it is literally torture) and I came across <b>round-trip tickets to Alicante for $360</b> during my Spring Break!!! There’s no way I could pass this up. A few friends and I made the journey and I got to see my dear, old friend María while I was there and celebrated my 22nd birthday. Perfect.
							</p>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<i>This Website –</i>
							<p>
								Starting a blog has been something I wanted to do for a really long time now. I have been out of work for a couple weeks, trying to uncover my dream job, when I realized several positions I was looking at wanted to see writing samples or asked for you to attach your website link. I read this as a sign and took the plunge. I think this platform is the perfect way for me to put something I am passionate about – writing and social media – and use it as a creative outlet and a portfolio for potential career opportunities.
							</p>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<i>My newer healthy lifestyle –</i>
							<p>
								I am very conscious about how I live my life. I am definitely the type to overindulge on sweets and go a few days without exercising, but finally have been able to find a balance. I made a few changes to my diet (these changes will be in a blog coming soon) and picked up a few days to go running, and it’s crazy what the difference I’ve seen is. Baby steps really bring you a long way – you just have to be patient and persistent.
							</p>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<i>Keeping close with high school and college friends –</i>
							<p>
								I am definitely the type to only have a few really close friends. Not that I can’t make new friends, but I strongly value long-term friendships that have roots. I am so lucky that I am still so close with a few high school friends and a few friends from college. Not just texting and social media friends, but people I actually get to see in person on the regular. Even my friends that I became so close to while I was overseas being still so close to me, it doesn’t even feel like we are thousands of miles apart. These people are what keeps me anchored and helped me enjoy another year – so thank you!
							</p>
					</li>			
				</ol>
				<p>
					So, what are you thankful for? Is it corndogs like me? Or something else?<br>

					I’d love to read what you have to say! Send me a note from the “Contact” page or leave a comment! Keep checking up for new posts and more easily track those on my Instagram: @acupofjosie<br>
